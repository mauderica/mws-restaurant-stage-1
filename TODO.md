#### _Restaurant Review App - Stage 1_

### General

* ~~Fork and clone the starter repository. The code in this repository will serve as your baseline to begin development.~~
* ~~You'll need your own Google Maps API key. Replace the text YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY on line 37 of index.html with your own key.~~
* Explore and understand the provided code. -- _in progress_
* As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
* Make sure your code adheres to our HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git style guidelines.
* Review the project rubric to ensure all requirements are met.

### Responsive Design

* Convert the provided site to use a responsive design. (Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used; all responsiveness should be done with CSS.)
* ~~Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags.~~
* Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS.
* Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes.
* Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device.
    #### Rubric Criteria:
* Is the site UI compatible with a range of display sizes?
    * All content is responsive and displays on a range of display sizes.
    * Content should make use of available screen real estate and should display correctly at all screen sizes.
    * An image's associated title and text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes.
* Are images responsive?
    * Images in the site are sized appropriate to the viewport and do not crowd or overlap other elements in the browser, regardless of viewport size.
* Are application elements visible and usable in all viewports?
    * On the main page, restaurants and images are displayed in all viewports.
    * The detail page includes a map, hours and reviews in all viewports.

### Accessibility (A11y)

* Implement accessibility features in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions).
    #### Rubric Criteria:
* Are images accessible?
    * All content-related images include appropriate alternate text that clearly describes the content of the image.
* Is focus used appropriately to allow easy navigation of the site?
    * Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page.
    * Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.
* Are site elements defined semantically?
    * Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements.
    * For those elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate ARIA roles are defined.

### Offline Use

* Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline. Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.
    #### Rubric Criteria:
* Are pages that have been visited available offline?
    * When available in the browser, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets.
    * Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.
